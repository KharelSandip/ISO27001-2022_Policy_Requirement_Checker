# Automated ISO 27001 Policy-to-Requirement Checker







## Overview



This is a Python-based project that uses AI (Machine Learning) to automatically assess how well an organization's information security policies align with the ISO 27001 standard. By comparing the semantic similarity between policy text and ISO 27001 requirements, the tool offers insights into policy effectiveness.



## Features



* Analyzes text from internal security policies.

* Compares policy text against ISO 27001 requirements and Annex A controls.

* Uses sentence embeddings to understand the semantic meaning of text.

* Calculates and displays the similarity scores between policies and ISO 27001 elements.

* Provides a simple web interface using Streamlit for ease of use.



## Getting Started



### Prerequisites



* Python 3.x

* pip (Python package installer)



### Installation



1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash

    git clone <repo_url>

    cd iso27001_compliance_checker

    ```

2.  Install the required Python libraries:

    ```bash

    pip install <materials.txt>

    ```

    *(You'll need to download and install python libraries form python dictionary.)*



### Usage



1.  Ensure the ISO 27001 requirements and your policy documents are placed in the `data/iso27001/` and `data/policies/` directories, respectively (you might need to structure these further based on the data processing scripts).

2.  Run the main script 

    ```bash

    python src/main.py

    ```

    

3.  Follow the instructions in the application to upload or process your policies and view the alignment results.
